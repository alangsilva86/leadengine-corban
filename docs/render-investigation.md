# Render PostgreSQL Investigation Status

## Summary
- Unable to access the Render dashboard from the current execution environment.
- No network credentials are available to reach the managed PostgreSQL cluster.
- Requested database connectivity checks and Prisma migrations could not be executed.

## Blockers
1. **Render Dashboard Access**
   - Browser-based authentication is required to inspect the `leadengine_corban` PostgreSQL service status.
   - The current container has no GUI or authenticated session to Render, so the dashboard cannot be opened.
2. **Database Connectivity**
   - The environment does not include the `DATABASE_URL` secrets required to connect with `psql`.
   - Without network access to the managed cluster, connection attempts would fail.
3. **Migration & Log Verification**
   - Because the database connectivity cannot be validated, running `pnpm --filter apps/api prisma migrate deploy` would be unsafe and unverifiable.
   - Log streams for the API (`apps/api`) and the broker are only accessible via the Render dashboard or CLI with appropriate credentials, which are unavailable.

## Suggested Next Steps
- A team member with Render dashboard access should log in, confirm the PostgreSQL service status, and restart or escalate to Render support if necessary.
- Once access is confirmed, run `psql "$DATABASE_URL"` from a trusted environment that holds the production secrets, followed by `pnpm --filter apps/api prisma migrate deploy` to ensure schema synchronization.
- Monitor the API and broker logs directly within Render after the database issue is resolved to confirm the absence of `PrismaClientInitializationError` and HTTP 500 responses.
