# Changelog

## 2025-04-19

### Changed
- Simplified the chat conversation header by deleting unused action button styles and related placeholder constants.

## 2025-03-28

### Breaking
- `WHATSAPP_MODE` is no longer tolerated in any environment. The configuration layer aborts application startup when the variable is present, ensuring that all deployments rely solely on the HTTP broker configuration.

### Changed
- Updated health checks, smoke tests and documentation to reflect the HTTP-only transport, clarifying the minimal environment variables required (`WHATSAPP_BROKER_URL`, `WHATSAPP_BROKER_API_KEY`, `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_API_KEY`, optional HMAC secret) and the removal of sidecar/dry-run toggles.
- Refreshed deployment, Docker and architecture guides with migration steps for removing the legacy flag and emphasised observability dashboards that monitor the single transport mode.

### Operations
- Release validation now requires `pnpm run test`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run typecheck` and the WhatsApp smoke test hitting `/healthz` to confirm the HTTP transport.
- Follow-up action: schedule ts-prune/unused export sweeps after rollout to ensure no dormant sidecar code remains.

## 2025-03-01

### Breaking
- WhatsApp transport now runs exclusively in HTTP mode; deprecated dry-run, disabled and sidecar pipelines have been removed. Environments must drop the `WHATSAPP_MODE` toggle and rely on broker configuration alone.

### Changed
- Health payloads, integration routes and smoke tests now always report the HTTP transport and surface configuration errors when the broker is incomplete.
- Documentation and observability guides no longer reference dry-run/disabled modes and explain the single-mode rollout, including migration steps for integrators.
- Docker Compose manifests no longer mount the deprecated `whatsapp_sessions_data` volume and omit unused WhatsApp mode environment variables.

### Removed
- Legacy sidecar runtime, dry-run transport and related feature flag plumbing have been deleted from the API codebase.
## 2025-02-25

### Changed
- Removed support for the WhatsApp sidecar transport across docs and Docker manifests, standardising on the HTTP broker configuration.

### Removed
- Dropped the `whatsapp_sessions_data` volume and any sidecar-specific environment variables from local and production Compose files. Operators should delete the orphaned volume and decommission sidecar containers during the upgrade.

## 2025-02-14

### Changed
- Documented the unified WhatsApp transport interface and consolidated the inbound pipeline without fallbacks across README, ADR 0003 and architecture notes.
- Updated deployment guides and Docker Compose manifests to require the persistent `whatsapp_sessions_data` volume and clarify `WHATSAPP_MODE` rollback (superseded by the 2025-03-01 HTTP-only release).
- Enhanced `scripts/whatsapp-smoke-test.ts` to auto-detect transport mode via `/healthz`, support sidecar pipelines and optional API keys.
- Removed zombie dependencies, introduced `pnpm depcheck`/`pnpm ts-prune` scripts and added missing workspace dependencies.

### Added
- Recorded dependency audit results in `DEPLOY_REPORT.md` and introduced this changelog for future releases.
